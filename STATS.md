### ⚠️ Notices
1. A Supabase-related folder (`supabase/`) containing two files (`config.toml` and `index.ts`) was unintentionally committed in **PR #104** (authored by **@Lefteris Lemontzoglou**). This added **574 lines** in total and was missed during code review. Those lines have been removed from the manual (+) count, and the files have since been deleted.
