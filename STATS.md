### ⚠️ Notices
1. The contributor **@PanosMasman** (Panagiotis Masmanidis) had mistakenly committed the HTML report files (including the `htmlReport` directory) and **Test Results - MovieControllerTest.html** with a total of **1429 lines** that has nothing to do with the project. These lines have been excluded from their Manual (+) count above. It was to test his code and he forgot to remove it.

2. A Supabase-related folder (`supabase/`) containing two files (`config.toml` and `index.ts`) was unintentionally committed in **PR #104** (authored by **@Lefteris Lemontzoglou**). This added **574 lines** in total and was missed during code review. Those lines have been removed from the manual (+) count, and the files have since been deleted.
